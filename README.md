# SQ speed variation vibration signal data set

Here, we expose a variable speed dataset based on vibration signals to provide a Benchmark Dataset for peer-to-peer measurement of algorithmic model performance to advance the field of research.





## 1. Introduction 

Realizing fault diagnosis under variable speed conditions is not only significant for fault diagnosis of equipment operating under time-varying load and power, but also provides the necessary technical support for realizing full-cycle condition monitoring of equipment including start-up and shutdown phases.
